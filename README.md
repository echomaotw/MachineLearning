Convolutional Neural Network

Week2: Residual Networks (ResNets) example
ResNets can help to solve the common problem of exploding gradient in deep learning.
The example uses Keras to train a very deep CNN to identify number 1-9 in pictures.

Week3: YOLO algorithm example
The example uses YOLO algorithm to detect the car in pictures.
